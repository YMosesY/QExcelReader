# Background

My girl friend is employed in IBM comp and she often had to cc hundreds of clients in a single email. The email addresses are recorded in a Excel file in one column. So I wrote this tool to dump the addresses in one string and split them with " ; " . She just needs to copy the string and post it to outlook, instead of copying the addresses one by one.
